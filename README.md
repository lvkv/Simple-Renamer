    while profiting:
      MISCHIEVOUS BOY: "Can you rename all subdirectories (and files within those directories) on this server so 
      that " + classmate_name + " is replaced with 'Smelly Face'?"

      profit += charge
      # Become infinitely rich as there is no risk of overflow due to arbitrary integer precision
